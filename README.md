Project Euler Solutions - Python 3.x
====================================

Scaffolding a new solution
--------------------------
Use the `scaffold.py` file at the root to quickly generate the skeleton for a new solution. The only parameter the script accepts is an integer corresponding to the problem number.

For example: `python3 scaffold.py 11` will generate a folder named **p011** and a file for tests in the **tests** folder.
